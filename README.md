## Introduction <a name="intro"></a>
Morgan State University is attempting to delve into the world of Artificial Intelligence. This project is meant to act as a jumping off point for a future endeavors and build a platform that students can learn from and build upon.

## The Build Construction <a name="intro"></a>

### Bill of Materials <a name="intro"></a>

This section lists the parts needed to build the MSU RACECAR. After you have received the parts and confirmed them, proceed to the hardware setup. Some of the parts are 3D printed. In these cases, the STL files have been made available along with recommended print settings.

```Disclaimer: Most of the URLs are from the OEM. You can probably find it cheaper elsewhere, e.g. Amazon.```

### Wiring
<img src="images/image12.jpg" alt="Wiring Diagram"/>In order to simplify powering the nano I chose to pull power from the RC battery to a LM2596 as shown above.

## Software Setup
### ROS
Follow the basic instructions to install Ubuntu 16.04. This requires an at least 16 GB SD card so have one on hand before starting. 
Once that process is complete, finish by installing ROS kinetic with the provided  instructions.

``` Only the base version is necessary but if you would like to use the GUI tools in my experience they will run fine.```

### Arduino
After which you should clone the git repo into the root of your device. Running the ./setup.sh installation script in the GitHub will install additional dependencies for ROS. Run ls /dev/tty* to find which port your arduino is attached on. cd into [Moonbear/src/roboguide/arduino/]() and run ‘ino build; ino upload -p ${port}’

### Bluetooth
Just install the Joy Bluetooth Commander from the play store and pair to the HC-06 device within the app

## Startup
For either mode it's necessary to power the computer since there is no on or off switch manually plugging and unplugging the RC battery cable is the best way to go about turning the system on and off.

```Though this didn't raise issues during development you should shut down the nano separately via SSH first```
### Manual 
### Autonomous 
In a new terminal run ‘roslaunch rc.launch’ to run the ros control
