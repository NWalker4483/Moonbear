## Introduction <a name="intro"></a>
Morgan State University is attempting to delve into the world of Artificial Intelligence. This project is meant to act as a jumping off point for a future endeavors and build a platform that students can learn from and build upon.

## The Build Construction <a name="intro"></a>

### Bill of Materials <a name="intro"></a>

This section lists the parts needed to build the MSU RACECAR. After you have received the parts and confirmed them, proceed to the hardware setup. Some of the parts are 3D printed. In these cases, the STL files have been made available along with recommended print settings.

```Disclaimer: Most of the URLs are from the OEM. You can probably find it cheaper elsewhere, e.g. Amazon.```

### Wiring

<img width="200px"  src="images/image13.jpg" alt="Wiring Diagram"/>

In order to simplify powering the nano I chose to pull power from the RC battery to a LM2596 as shown above. 

<img width="200px"  src="images/image12.jpg" alt="Wiring Diagram"/>

Connect the Arduino micro and the HC-06 as defined above if the references aren't clear in the photos, the pin definitions can be found at the top of the arduino [script](src/roboguide/arduino/src/src.ino)

## Software Setup
### ROS
* Follow the basic instructions to install Ubuntu 18.04. This requires an at least 16 GB SD card so have one on hand before starting. 

* Once that process is complete, finish by installing ROS melodic with one of the methods below.
#### Method 1: 
* Follow the instructions to install ROS Melodic Desktop. http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu
#### Method 2: 
* Install from the JetsonHacksNano repo. https://github.com/JetsonHacksNano/installROS

``` Only the base version is necessary but if you would like to use the GUI tools like rviz in my experience they will run fine.```

Once ROS is installed. Install these ROS package dependencies

``` sudo apt-get install \ 
ros-melodic-realsense2-camera \
ros-melodic-joy \
ros-melodic-joy-teleop-twist \
ros-melodic-openni-launch \
ros-melodic-rosserial-arduino \ 
ros-melodic-rosserial \
ros-melodic-slam-gmapping \
ros-melodic-amcl \  
ros-melodic-move-base \
ros-melodic-robot-upstart \  
ros-melodic-pointcloud-to-laserscan
```

```Librealsense is necessary for using the **realsense2-camera** package. Some of the documentation says that it is installed by default but that hasn't worked in my case so I recommend you follow this [tutorial](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense) to install it separately.```

After the dependencies have been installed clone this repository into your ```workspace/src``` folder as a package and run ```catkin_make;source /devel/setup.bash```

A tutorial on how to make a ROS workspace can be found [here](http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/create_a_workspace)
### Arduino
* After plugging in your Arduino, run ```ls /dev/tty*``` to find which port your arduino is attached on. 
* cd into [arduino/](arduino/) and run ```ino build; ino upload -p ${port}```. This uploads the script to your arduino board. 
* Connect the ```SteeringControlPin```(Pin 9 by default) to the control line for the steering servo.
* Connect the ```ThrottleControlPin```(Pin 12 by default) to the control line for the blue ESC.

### Bluetooth
Just install the Joy Bluetooth Commander from the play store and pair to the HC-06 device within the app by moving the joystick. 

## Startup
For either mode it's necessary to power the computer since there is no on or off switch manually plugging and unplugging the RC battery cable is the best way to go about turning the system on and off.

```Though this didn't raise issues during development you should shut down the nano separately via SSH first```
### Manual 
Turning on the setup without connecting **Bluetooth Mode Jumper** will startup the car in bluetooth mode. Then launch the App and start driving.
### Autonomous 
 In a new terminal run ```roslaunch rc.launch``` to run the ROS control. After it succesfully connects to the arduino run ```roslaunch mapping.launch``` on either the host machine to run exploration and mapping of the area. The car will stop running when it runs out of search areas
## Sanity Checks
#### librealsense
* Once librealsense is installed properly you should be able to run the realsense-viewer command in terminal. This will bring up a window that allows you to view the data coming from either camera.
#### ROS Nodes 
* In order to check that all of the notes are launching properly first look at the output of the Ross launch command for info.
* If that doesn't work running the command ```rqt_graph``` will open up a window showing you which notes are sending data to which subscribers.

#### Arduino ```WARN: Remove the wheels or prop up before testing```
In order to check that the Arduino is connected and set up properly connect pin 11 to 5v. This will launch the car and serial control mode. By opening up a serial monitor and connecting to the port you found earlier you should be able to send commands directly to the car through this. Sending ```T25``` should set the throttle to 25% of the max throttle. Sending ```S90``` should set the steering wheels to 90 degrees aka straight forward.

## Bugs
#### No Realsense device found when the realsense is plugged in:
* Check that the
